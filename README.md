Player Attributes
Player Attributes in FIFA Ultimate Team
In FIFA, Player Attributes are the data and information that determine the quality and the feature of a player's technical skills, behaviours and performance on the pitch. In FIFA, FUT and FIFA Mobile, each player has a collection of attributes rated from 0 to 99 each. The average of a player's attributes sums up their OVR RATING
Player Attributes are rated first as a guesswork by EA's data reviewers who are made up of coaches, professional scouts, and a lot of season ticket holders from around the world. Then, EA editors will go through these data to review them and apply their own feedback to them, and then they make the final player attribute ratings ready for the game.
